We use this algorithm:
1. Choose a set of five words. Review it for a while, then move on to another
   set of words.
2. If the word hasn't been seen before, show the foreign language, then
   show the local language.
3. Try to show a lot of known words, don't overwhelm with discomfort.
4. groups of words:
      unknown words.
		familiar, can recognize it in foreign language and type in native.
		can type it in foreign language given the native language.
		   At that point, move it to the final group, start showing it less
		   Finally, once it is well known, show it based on least recently seen
