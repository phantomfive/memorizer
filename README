A program to help review and memorize Russian, and Japanese vocabulary words.
It can actually be used for any language, but
I will be updating it from time to time with Russian and Japanese vocabulary.

To use:

1) Download the source.
2) type: make
3) type: ./japanese
     or: ./russian

If you don't have a database, one will be created.
Relies on SQLite.
Only tested on OSX, if you find errors on other platforms, please let me know.
